# ThinkTime-CSS-fixes

Fixes for usability and design issues on the ThinkTime platform's web interface.
This CSS file or its content can be used inside any style-changing extension, e.g., Stylebot (personal recommendation), Styler, or Tampermonkey.
It mostly tested only in Chrome desktop and Kiwi mobile browsers from my side.
